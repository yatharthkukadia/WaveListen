# WaveListen
End-to-End ASR system in PyTorch with conv + BiGRU architecture, CTC loss, and custom decoding. Built without pre-trained APIs, featuring MFCC/spectrogram preprocessing, noise handling, GPU-accelerated training, and WER-based evaluation.

# ðŸŽ§ WaveListen

WaveListen is a Speech-to-Text (STT) project built from scratch using deep learning techniques.  
It is designed to convert audio into accurate text without relying on third-party APIs.
